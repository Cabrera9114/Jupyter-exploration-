What I Did

The first step I took was creating a GitHub account. I then made a repository named “jupyter-exploration” by clicking the “+” icon, choosing “New repository,” and initializing it with a README file. I edited the README to introduce myself, as instructed.


When moving to Jupyter Notebooks, I initially struggled with the installation process. I attempted to download Jupyter Notebook and followed the instructions in the introductory PowerPoint and class lectures. Unfortunately, I encountered several obstacles and dead ends. A lot of my confusion started around this step. Both Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab were difficult to download and access.


Eventually, I navigated to Command Prompt via Python to access Jupyter Notebook, which proved to be a more effective approach. I had to follow steps from Medium.com which then took me to a page “localhost:8888/tree” url. I was able launched Jupyter Notebook from the command prompt, which opened the notebook dashboard. This allowed me to explore the interface, file list, and kernels essential for running code.


Creating my first notebook involved adding a Markdown cell with the text “My first markdown cell in Jupyter” and a Code cell with print("Hello, World!"). Running the code cell with Shift + Enter demonstrated the interactive nature of Jupyter Notebooks. I then saved the notebook and

uploaded it to the “jupyter-exploration” repository on GitHub. I was given the following https://github.com/brandiegriffin83/jupyter-exploration.git for my web address.


What I Learned

Despite spending time navigating Jupyter Notebook, I gained very little from the experience. The interface did not offer much insight, and I struggled to understand how the various cells worked together. Rather than deepening my knowledge, it seemed as if I was executing tasks mechanically without any real learning taking place. Overall, I am still unsure if I grasped the concepts I worked on.


Challenges and Solutions

One significant challenge was uploading the notebook from Jupyter to GitHub. Initially, I struggled with this process and had to attempt it several times. Despite my efforts, I am still confused about the exact procedure for syncing notebooks between GitHub and Jupyter. To resolve this, I sought additional guidance by reading articles on Medium.com, which provided detailed explanations and tips for managing Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub integration. These resources were helpful, though some aspects of the process remain unclear.


In Summary

This lab session was an insightful introduction to GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks, though I still have challenges to overcome in mastering these new tools. I believe I will need additional one-on-one tutorials to gain a clearer understanding of how Jupyter Notebook and GitHub work together
